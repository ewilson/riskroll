Risk Roller
===========

Simple Risk dice rolling program made with jQuery, Handlebars, and Bootstrap.

Deployed at AWS S3 [here](http://riskroll.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com)

### For development

In order to deploy locally, clone this repository, and then install dependencies with bower:

    $ bower install

I find Python convenient for serving contents to port 8000:

    $ python3 -m http.server

Then navigate to [localhost port 8000](http://localhost:8000)
